<p id="p1">Do you know what caused 1.7 million deaths alone in 2017?<br/>
Do you know what killed 35 million innocent people worldwide?<br/>
They are two transmissible diseases, also known as tuberculosis and HIV respectively. Transmissible diseases are one of the main causes of death worldwide.<br/>
Read on to find out how you can protect yourself from these deadly diseases.<br/>
<br/>
A transmissible disease is a contagious disease whereby is transmitted through contact, direct or indirect.<br/>
Direct contact is when blood exchange with an infected organism happens, or through droplet spread, which is when sneezing happens and droplets land on a person.<br/>
Indirect contact is when, for example, the transmissible disease is in the food that you ingest, or through animal bites, or through contaminated objects, (which are contaminated when, for example, an infected person touches a cup, and soon after, you touch that cup).<br/>



Transmissible diseases affect our daily lives when they are life-threatening, (e.g. SARS, MERS, ebola, AIDS, etc.). They affect the infected by rendering them not capable to work, as well as disabling them, or even killing them, especially when they are the sole breadwinner of the family<br/>.

They also affect the non-infected as they are scared to even go out onto the streets, as they risk a very high chance of infection. Transmissible diseases also cripple the economy, as nobody will even go to shops to buy food, supplies, etc. Thus, the economy in not only the country, but the world, will collapse if the whole country is a major one in resources (e.g. steel, coal, etc.). <br/>

For example, if a whole country supplies more than 50% of the worldâ€™s steel, the country relies on its steel trade to support its economy, and the country has a mass outbreak of a transmissible disease for an extended period of time, not only will the country will fall apart*, but the world will be affected as we use steel in our daily lives a lot, and there is a good alternative for steel, but is very rare. <br/>

* This is because very few miners will go out to mine steel as they are afraid of losing their life to that transmissible disease.<br/>




What can we do to protect ourselves from such deadly diseases?<br/>
<br/>
We can regularly sanitise our hands, such that when we touch something, it will not become contaminated.<br/>
<br/>
We can also get vaccinated if a disease is going or already is in Singapore or other countries that you are visiting.<br/>
<br/>
You can also stay at home if you are not feeling well, so you will not spread the disease to others.<br/>
<br/>
If we all play our part, Singapore will be disease-free.<br/>
<br/>
